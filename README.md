This lab only contains screenshots and a light demonstration of the steps that were taken in exploring the active directory and paramaters .
Three virtual machines were created using VMware : Windows server 2003 , Windows 10 and Windows 7 .
The objective was to create a domain and to group the two end-users under one group policy object and control them under policies of choice .
As an example i chosed to restrict any insertion of removable storage access such as usbs .
Another experementation was to prevent the end-users from changing their TCP\IP settings . 
And lastly i activated an automatic software deployment and installation of microsoft office .
It should be noted that many procedures can be applied such as security measures like configuring passwords and file permissions ect .
